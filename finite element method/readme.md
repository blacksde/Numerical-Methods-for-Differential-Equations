#Finite element method

This is the project that uses finite element method to solve Laplace equation, diffusion equation and wave equation.

Proj2mesh.m is the function to generate mesh for the equation.
showsol.m are provided in the project 2 package.

Kmatrix.m is the function generating K matrix in the finite element method.

Mmatrix.m is the function generating M matrix for the diffusion equation and wave equation.

The definitions of K and M are in the lecture notes 18 and 19.

Laplace equation.m is the solution to Laplace equation.

Diffusion equation.m is the solution to Diffusion equation.

Wave equation.m is the solution to Wave equation.

stable.m is the script to draw stable region for each method.

slope.m is the script to discuss the relation between dt and dx.
