# Molecular dynamics
This is the project that simulating molecular dynamics.

## Task
Simulating molecular dynamics with the potential function given by -12[1/r^13-1/r^7].

##Script
dpotential.m is the function of derivative of the potential function given by -12[1/r^13-1/r^7].

ffuntion.m is the 2D molecular dynamics motion equation.

project1error.m is the script for error analysis.

project1boiling.m is the script of calculating boiling point.

## Graph
Here is the graph of boiling points.

## Video
Here is the video for low temp.

Here is the video for high temp.
