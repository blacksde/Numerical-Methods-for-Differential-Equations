# Molecular dynamics
This is the project that simulating molecular dynamics.

## Task
Simulating molecular dynamics with the potential function given by -12[1/r^13-1/r^7].

##Script
[dpotential.m](https://github.com/blacksde/Numerical-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Molecular%20dynamics/dpotential.m) is the function of derivative of the potential function given by -12[1/r^13-1/r^7].

[ffuntion.m](https://github.com/blacksde/Numerical-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Molecular%20dynamics/ffuntion.m) is the 2D molecular dynamics motion equation.

[project1error.m](https://github.com/blacksde/Numerical-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Molecular%20dynamics/project1error.m) is the script for error analysis.

[project1boiling.m](https://github.com/blacksde/Numerical-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Molecular%20dynamics/project1boiling.m) is the script of calculating boiling point.

## Graph
[Here](https://github.com/blacksde/Numerical-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Molecular%20dynamics/Boiling%20point.jpg) is the graph of volume at different temp and also boiling point.

## Video
[Here](https://github.com/blacksde/Numerical-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Molecular%20dynamics/low_temp_anim.avi) is the video for low temp.

[Here](https://github.com/blacksde/Numerical-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Molecular%20dynamics/high_temp_anim.avi) is the video for high temp.
